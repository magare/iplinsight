# App Data Directory

This directory contains processed data files used by the Streamlit application for visualization and analysis.

## Data Files

The application expects the following data files:

- `matches.parquet`: Contains match-level information
- `deliveries.parquet`: Contains ball-by-ball information
- Season-specific files (generated during processing):
  - `season_YYYY_batting_stats.csv`: Batting statistics for each season
  - `season_YYYY_bowling_stats.csv`: Bowling statistics for each season
  - `season_YYYY_all_round_stats.csv`: All-rounder statistics for each season
  - `season_YYYY_fielding_stats.csv`: Fielding statistics for each season
  - `season_YYYY_points_progression.csv`: Points table progression for each season
  - `season_YYYY_standings.csv`: Final standings for each season
  - `season_YYYY_key_matches.csv`: Key matches for each season
  - `season_YYYY_stats.csv`: Overall statistics for each season

## Data Generation

These files are generated by the data processing scripts in the `data/` directory. To regenerate the data:

1. Place raw data files in the `data/raw/` directory
2. Run the processing script: `python data/process_data.py`
3. The processed files will be automatically copied to this directory

## Data Format

All data files follow a consistent format with appropriate column names and data types. The Parquet files are optimized for efficient storage and fast reading.
