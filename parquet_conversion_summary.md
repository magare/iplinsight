# Parquet Conversion Summary

## Changes Made

1. Updated the `load_precomputed_data` function in `app/components/season_analysis.py` to use Parquet files instead of CSV files:

   - Modified the function to automatically convert CSV file paths to Parquet file paths
   - Removed special handling for index columns as Parquet preserves index information

2. Updated direct CSV file references in the following files:

   - `app/components/dream_team_analysis.py`: Changed `pd.read_csv` to `pd.read_parquet`
   - `app/components/player_analysis.py`: Changed `pd.read_csv` to `pd.read_parquet` for all player statistics files
   - `app/components/team_analysis.py`: Changed `pd.read_csv` to `pd.read_parquet` for all team statistics files
   - `app/components/season_analysis.py`: Updated file extensions from `.csv` to `.parquet` in the `load_season_stats` function

3. Created missing Parquet files:
   - Created a script `convert_csv_to_parquet.py` to convert missing CSV files to Parquet format
   - Converted the following files:
     - `dream_team_stats.csv`
     - Season points progression files for seasons 2008-2021

## Benefits

1. **Faster Loading Times**: Parquet files load 5-10x faster than CSV files
2. **Smaller File Sizes**: Parquet files are more compact than CSV files
3. **Preserved Metadata**: Parquet preserves index information and data types
4. **Consistency**: All data files now use the same format

## Testing

The application was tested after making these changes and is working correctly. The Streamlit app loads and displays data without errors.

# JSON to Parquet Conversion Summary

## Changes Made

1. **Added JSON to Parquet Conversion Function**

   - Added a new function `convert_json_to_parquet()` to `data/process_data.py`
   - This function converts all JSON files in the app/data directory to Parquet format
   - Added a command-line argument `--convert-json-to-parquet` to trigger the conversion

2. **Modified Venue Analysis Component**

   - Added a new function `load_precomputed_parquet()` to `app/components/venue_analysis.py`
   - Updated all data loading functions to use Parquet files instead of JSON files
   - Added fallback to JSON if Parquet files are not available

3. **Modified Dream Team Analysis Component**
   - Added a new function `load_precomputed_parquet()` to `app/components/dream_team_analysis.py`
   - Updated all data loading functions to use Parquet files instead of JSON files
   - Added fallback to JSON if Parquet files are not available

## Bug Fixes

1. **Fixed Dream Team Analysis Component**
   - Fixed the data loading functions in `app/components/dream_team_analysis.py` to handle the different data structure in Parquet files
   - The JSON files were dictionaries with keys for seasons, venues, players, etc., but the Parquet files were converted to DataFrames with columns
   - Updated the following functions to handle both formats:
     - `load_dream_team_all_time_stats()`
     - `load_dream_team_season_stats(season)`
     - `load_dream_team_venue_stats(venue)`
     - `load_dream_team_player_history(player)`
     - `load_dream_team_match_team(match_id)`
     - `load_dream_team_all_matches()`
   - Added fallback to JSON if Parquet loading fails or if the data structure is not as expected

## Benefits

1. **Improved Performance**

   - Parquet files are more efficient to load than JSON files
   - Parquet files are columnar, allowing for faster queries and filtering
   - Parquet files are compressed, reducing disk space usage

2. **Better Type Handling**

   - Parquet preserves data types, unlike JSON which converts everything to strings
   - This reduces the need for type conversion when loading data

3. **Backward Compatibility**
   - The code still supports JSON files as a fallback if Parquet files are not available
   - This ensures the app will continue to work even if some files haven't been converted

## Files Converted

The following JSON files were converted to Parquet format:

1. venue_metadata.json
2. venue_team_performance.json
3. venue_scoring_patterns.json
4. venue_toss_impact.json
5. venue_weather_impact.json
6. dream_team_all_time_stats.json
7. dream_team_season_stats.json
8. dream_team_venue_stats.json
9. dream_team_player_history.json
10. dream_team_match_teams.json
11. dream_team_all_matches.json

## How to Run the Conversion

To convert JSON files to Parquet format, run:

```bash
python data/process_data.py --convert-json-to-parquet
```

This will convert all JSON files in the app/data directory to Parquet format.
